Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research.
1. Introduction
Machine learning (ML) approaches are used in many fields, ranging from supermarkets to evaluate the behavior of customers (Ayodele, 2010) to the prediction of customersâ€™ phone use (Witten et al., 2016). Machine learning is also being used in agriculture for several years (McQueen et al., 1995). Crop yield prediction is one of the challenging problems in precision agriculture, and many models have been proposed and validated so far. 

2. Related work
Crop yield prediction is an essential task for the decision-makers at national and regional levels (e.g., the EU level) for rapid decision-making. An accurate crop yield prediction model can help farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow. There are different approaches to crop yield prediction. This review article has investigated what has been done on the use of machine learning in crop yield prediction in the literature.
3. Methodology
3.1. Review protocol
Before conducting the systematic review, a review protocol is defined. The review has been done using the well-known review guidelines provided by Kitchenham et al. (2007). Firstly, the research questions are defined. When research questions are ready, databases are used to select the relevant studies. The databases that were used in this study are Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, Wiley, and Google Scholar. After the selection of relevant studies, they were filtered and assessed using a set of exclusion and quality criteria.
